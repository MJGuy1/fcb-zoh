MJ Guy

I want to transition into a tech career as a Quality Assurance professional. To do that, I need a strong foundation in coding and software concepts. My motivation for joining this open house workshop by Zuitt it to assess my ability and patience - to see if I can still absorb technical knowledge and apply it in a practical and hands-on environment.
