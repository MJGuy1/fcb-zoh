MJ Guy

I want to transition into a tech career as a Quality Assurance professional. To do that, I need a strong foundation in coding and software concepts. My motivation for joining this open house workshop by Zuitt it to assess my ability and patience - to see if I can still absorb technical knowledge and apply it in a practical and hands-on environment.

I am currently working as a Data Analyst, supporting the Marketing Operations. I collect, analyze and present key operational metrics. Creating clear and insightful presentations to help the marketing team track performance and make data-driven decisions.
